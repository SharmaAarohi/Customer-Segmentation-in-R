# Customer-Segmentation-in-R
Customer Segmentation and market basket analysis in R Programming using k-means clustering, Revenue-Monetary-Frequency (RMF) values and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculation.

# MODELLING TECHNIQUES

Data Cleaning:
Missing Values: Any missing values in the dataset will be identified and removed using the na.omit() function.
Canceled Invoices: Canceled invoices will be identified based on negative quantities. These canceled invoices will be filtered out from the dataset.

Feature Extraction:
Day, Month, and Year: The InvoiceDate column will be parsed to extract the day, month, and year information.
Hour and Minute: The InvoiceDate column will be parsed to extract the hour and minute information.
Total Price: The total price for each transaction will be calculated by multiplying the quantity and unit price.
Description Length: The length of the description for each item will be calculated.

RFM Analysis:
Recency: The number of days since the last transaction will be calculated by finding the difference between the maximum and current invoice dates.
Frequency: The number of unique invoices per customer will be calculated.
Monetary: The total monetary value of purchases per customer will be calculated by summing the product of quantity and unit price.
RFM Scores: The RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) will be divided into quartiles to assign scores.
RFM Segments: RFM scores will be combined to create RFM segments based on the quartile ranges.
Marketing Strategies:
Based on the RFM segments, specific marketing strategies will be defined:
VIP customers (RFM Segment 111): Provide personalized offers and exclusive perks to retain and encourage their loyalty.
Low-value customers (RFM Segment 444): Focus on retention and reactivation campaigns to increase their value.
Potential high-value customers (RFM Segments 211, 212, 311, 312): Offer incentives to increase their frequency and monetary value.
Other segments: Tailor marketing strategies based on segment characteristics to optimize customer engagement and sales.

Data Visualizations:
UnitPrice by Quantity: A scatter plot will be created to visualize the relationship between unit price and quantity.
Revenue by InvoiceDate: A line plot will display the revenue trend over time by aggregating the quantity * unit price by invoice date.
Revenue by Country: A bar plot will show the total revenue generated by each country, highlighting the top-performing countries.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):
Total Revenue per Customer: The total revenue per customer will be calculated by summing the quantity * unit price for each transaction.
Average Order Value per Customer: The average order value per customer will be calculated by dividing the total order value by the number of unique invoices.
Purchase Frequency per Customer: The purchase frequency per customer will be calculated by counting the number of unique invoices.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): The CLV will be estimated by multiplying the average order value, purchase frequency, and average customer lifespan.
High-Value Customers: The CLV data will be sorted in descending order to identify high-value customers.

Removing Outliers:
Box Plot: A box plot will be created to visualize the distribution of the total price column and identify potential outliers.
Z-Score Calculation: The z-scores for the total price will be calculated to identify outliers.
Outlier Threshold: An outlier threshold (e.g., z-score > 3 or < -3) will be defined to filter out the outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Revenue by Country: A bar plot will display the total revenue generated by each country, highlighting the top-performing countries.
Item Description Analysis: Word clouds or frequency analysis will be used to identify popular items based on their descriptions.
Invoice Distribution: A histogram or bar plot will visualize the distribution of invoices per day, month, and year.

Customer Segmentation: Cluster analysis or segmentation techniques can be applied to identify distinct customer groups based on their behavior and demographics.
Correlation Analysis: Correlation between different variables (e.g., quantity, unit price, and total price) can be calculated to identify relationships.
These expected outcomes specify the calculations and finer points for each step in the report, including data cleaning, feature extraction, RFM analysis, marketing strategies, data visualizations, customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis, outlier removal, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
